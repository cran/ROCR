\title{Class \code{prediction}}
\description{
Object to encapsulate numerical predictions together with the
corresponding true class labels, optionally collecting predictions and
labels for several cross-validation or bootstrapping runs.
}
\section{Slots}{

\describe{
\item{\code{predictions}}{A list, in which each element is a vector of predictions
(the list has length > 1 for x-validation data.}

\item{\code{labels}}{Analogously, a list in which each element is a vector of true
class labels.}

\item{\code{cutoffs}}{A list in which each element is a vector of all necessary
cutoffs. Each cutoff vector consists of the predicted scores (duplicates
removed), in descending order.}

\item{\code{fp}}{A list in which each element is a vector of the number (not the
rate!) of false positives induced by the cutoffs given in the corresponding
'cutoffs' list entry.}

\item{\code{tp}}{As fp, but for true positives.}

\item{\code{tn}}{As fp, but for true negatives.}

\item{\code{fn}}{As fp, but for false negatives.}

\item{\code{n.pos}}{A list in which each element contains the number of positive
samples in the given x-validation run.}

\item{\code{n.neg}}{As n.pos, but for negative samples.}

\item{\code{n.pos.pred}}{A list in which each element is a vector of the number of
samples predicted as positive at the cutoffs given in the corresponding
'cutoffs' entry.}

\item{\code{n.neg.pred}}{As n.pos.pred, but for negatively predicted samples.}
}}

\note{
Every \code{prediction} object contains information about the 2x2
contingency table consisting of tp,tn,fp, and fn, along with the
marginal sums n.pos,n.neg,n.pos.pred,n.neg.pred, because these form
the basis for many derived performance measures.
